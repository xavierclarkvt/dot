# Dot

These are my MacOS and Ubuntu dotfiles. Due to it's heavy reliance on Homebrew, really only for MacOS. 

Ubuntu behavior only installs stow and links dotfiles. Does not support bash shells, you will need to install `zsh`.

Forked from [webpro/dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles) - if you want a custom version of this, use his.

## Highlights

- Minimal efforts to install everything, using a [shell script](./install.sh)
- Mostly based around Homebrew, Caskroom and Node.js, latest Bash + GNU Utils
- Great [Window management](./config/hammerspoon/README.md) (using Hammerspoon)
- Fast and colored prompt
- Updated macOS defaults
- Well-organized and easy to customize
- Supports both Apple Silicon (M1) and Intel chips

## Packages Overview

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (packages: [Brewfile](./install/Brewfile))
- [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) (packages: [Caskfile](./install/Caskfile))
- [Node.js + npm LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (packages: [npmfile](./install/npmfile))
- Latest Git, Python 3, GNU coreutils, curl, Rust
- [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) (config: [keybindings & window management](./config/hammerspoon))
- [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) (sync application settings)
- `$EDITOR` (and Git editor) is [GNU nano](https://www.nano-editor.org)

## Installation

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

If you don't have `zsh` as your current shell, you will need to install it:

```bash
sudo apt -y install zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
exec zsh -l
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make` (not available on stock macOS). Next you will need to clone the repo manually into the desired location:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xavierclarkvt/dot.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Use the [install script](./install.sh) to install everything [listed above](#package-overview), and symlink [runcom](./runcom)
and [config](./config) (using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)):

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
zsh install.sh
```

## Post-Installation

- `dot dock` (set [Dock items](./macos/dock.sh))
- `dot macos` (set [macOS defaults](./macos/defaults.sh))
- Mackup
  - Log in to Dropbox (and wait until synced)
  - `ln -s ~/.config/mackup/.mackup.cfg ~` (until [#632](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/632) is fixed)
  - `mackup restore`
